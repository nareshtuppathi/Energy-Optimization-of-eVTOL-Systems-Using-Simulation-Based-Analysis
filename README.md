# Energy Optimization of eVTOL Systems Using Simulation-Based Analysis

This repository contains the complete MATLAB/Simulink simulation and report files for our Master's case study project conducted at Deggendorf Institute of Technology, Campus Cham.

🎯 **Objective**  
To identify the most energy-efficient battery configuration for an electric Vertical Take-Off and Landing (eVTOL) system using a simulation-based, data-driven approach.

🛠️ **Tools & Technologies**  
- MATLAB R2023a  
- Simulink  
- Simscape / Electrical  
- Real-world datasheets from Ares, XTAR, and Keeppower

📦 **Repository Contents**  
- `Simulink_Model/` – `.slx` file with modular simulation blocks  
- `Battery_Data/` – Datasheets and specs of real batteries  
- `Results/` – Hover time vs weight & thrust graphs  
- `Final_Report.pdf` – Full technical documentation

📊 **Highlights**
- Built a realistic digital twin using MX860 drone and T-MOTOR MN6007  
- Simulated hover performance across battery types  
- Keeppower battery achieved 13.77% improvement in hover time over Ares  
- Validated weight-sensitive performance using Simscape models

📚 **How to Run**
1. Open `eVTOL_Model.slx` in MATLAB R2023a  
2. Run simulation from top-level model  
3. View hover time and thrust performance using built-in scopes/loggers
